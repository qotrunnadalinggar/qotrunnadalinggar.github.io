<p> <h2> Assalamualaikum gaes, </h2><br> <h3>Lemme introduce my self!</h3> 
	<img src="https://github.com/qotrunnadalinggar/tugas-labkom/blob/master/hobi%20nada.png?raw=true" width="300" height="400"> <br>
	<br> My name is Qotrunnada Linggar Pinanditi, you can call me Nada or Qotrun or whatever u want that makes me turn my head. <br> Like the picture above, I'm very beautiful, right? Yes, I have been aware since I was a baby HAHAHAH. <br> I'm from crowded city. Everyone must know. It's Jekardah. <br> I have a super dad, strong mom, and annoying brother. I love them so much, more than they love me :)<br> I study in Bogor Vocational High School of Chemical Analyst or people usually called it as SMAKBO <i>(sekolah membuat aku kurang bobo. lol.)</i> <br> 

	<br> <br> SMAKBO'S students aren't what you think, like uncommunicative, <i>"Kutu Buku"</i>, and manymore <br> I'm so excited to go to the school, because I can receive money and also I want to see doi MWEHEHE. <br> I'm a crazy person and I'm so proud of it. But, all of my weird friends are crazier than me HAHAHA. <br> For the example is like the gif below,<br> 75% reasons why I like to go to school, because I can do anything, especially positive activity. I can play, laugh, and feel happy YEAAYYY. <br> Only 25%, I go to school because I want to study WOKWOKWOK <br> <br>

	<p>I have an motivator and idola, that's Rasulullah SAW. but, I have an idola in real life too, that's Anthony Sinisuka Ginting. <br> As you've known, he is Indonesian badminton athlete that has many fans, especially from <i>"Kaum Hawa"</i> <br> Unfortunately, I've never met him HUHUHU :'( I hope, I can meet with him wherever and whenever it is at unexpected times ASAP AAMIIN AAMIIN. <br> Rn, I can only look at him through photos, like the picture below. So sad:( </p>

	<br> <br> I think that's all, if u want to know me more, kindly sent me a message. <br> <br> <br>
